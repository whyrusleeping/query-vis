# dht query vis
This is a simple tool to gather statistics about dht 'get value' queries.

## Installation
```
go get -u github.com/whyrusleeping/query-vis
```

## Usage
I've just been using this to query for ipns records.

```
query-vis /ipns/QmaCpDMGvV2BGHeYERUEnRQAwe3N8SzbUtfsmvsqQLuvuJ
```

## Future work
- routing table visualization
- sorting of peers to make sure the impl is pulling them off in the right order
- pretty graphics
- dancing cats
